# GenTech: Workshop - 1

This workshop was aimed at understanding the definitions of runtime and complexity. We looked at how to analyze the complexities of a variety of algorithms. Professor Watson also shared a number of tips and tricks to do well on technical interviews.


# Files and Folders

In the **Sample Questions** folder, you will find the example coding challenges we looked at in the workshop along with tests for them. The **Technical Interviews** PDF is the slide deck Professor Watson put together for the workshop; it summarizes the main points raised during the workshop and is a good point of reference.
